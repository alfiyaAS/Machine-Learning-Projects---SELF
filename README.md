# Machine Learning Projects [SELF]
## Hi, I am Alfiya Asif Sheikh!

### This repository contains some projects in machine learning along with jupyter notebook code files I create while solving those problems.

I regularly pick up new problems based on Kaggle competitions or other sources and try to create my own solutions for solving those problems. Handling various problems associated with different domains gives exposure and vision to handle obstacles in solving problems with efficiency and efficacy!

For checking my repository projects, you can go to the individual project folders and see the readme.md files for detailed instructions about the projects and my approach and results obtained for respective problems.

**My approach:** *Using a machine learning for solving problems should not be only cooncerned about creating a BLACK-BOX models giving excellent results, but the solutions should be able to explain how these results are obtained. This grants Explainability factor to the solution, which makes the models reliable.*
